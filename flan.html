    <h2>Flan</h2>

        <p><em>Flan</em> is a European and Latin dessert made up of a caramel topping and custard base that’s made with milk, eggs and sweetener (which may already be included in the milk). It is usually baked in a water bath for the best texture, and after baking it is chilled then later inverted onto a platter.</p>
        
    <h3>Ingrdients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1 package (8 ounces) cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>5 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 can (12 ounces) evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a heavy saucepan, cook sugar and water over medium-low heat until melted and golden, about 15 minutes. Brush down crystals on the side of the pan with additional water as necessary. Quickly pour into an ungreased 2-qt. round baking or souffle dish, tilting to coat the bottom; let stand for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°. In a bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, until thoroughly combined. Add remaining ingredients; mix well. Pour over caramelized sugar.</li>
        <li>Place the dish in a larger baking pan. Pour boiling water into larger pan to a depth of 1 in. Bake until the center is just set (mixture will jiggle), 50-60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove dish from a larger pan to a wire rack; cool for 1 hour. Refrigerate overnight.</li>
        <li>To unmold, run a knife around edges and invert onto a large rimmed serving platter. Cut into wedges or spoon onto dessert plates; spoon sauce over each serving.</li>
